Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction
This project predicts Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins using various Data Quality (DQ) metrics and input attributes. It uses machine learning (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to assist in estimating emissions more accurately based on historical data.

Features
