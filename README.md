#  Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction

This project predicts **Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins** using various **Data Quality (DQ)** metrics and input attributes. It leverages machine learning models like **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** to estimate emissions more accurately based on historical data.
